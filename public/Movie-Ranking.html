<h1>The Best Movies Ever According to Katarina </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>It's a great historic and epic movie with great actors. See it!</p>
<h3>Titanic</h3>
<p>A romatic drama movie set in a disaster.</p>
<h3>Pride and Prejudice</h3>
<p>Romantic historic drama at 19th centuary.</p>
<p>It seems like I have a preference for romantic and historic drama. Cause there is a love story in Gladiator too if you didnÂ´t know it.</p>
