<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a Speech and Language Pathologist who has decided to broaden my knowledge and learn how to code. 
I've choosen to start with web development because you get to work with design and visual elements.</p>

<p>When I write this I've only been doing tutorials for less than a week. 
I've gone through the basics of HTML and will start learning more about CSS soon. 
So bare with me for the minimalistic and 90's design on the website.</p>
